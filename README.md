CLyDE project - OpenSSD Development Tree
========================================

This is the development tree for specific changes for the OpenSSD Firmware code. The code are applied as from a branch to allow future updates of the master source code and allow rebase of changes from one release to another.

Contributing
------------

So you want to use the branch? Great! There are two ways. One is forking the dev branch and submit your patches. Another is to directly send us or the OpenSSD master maintainers an e-mail (depending on which branch you're using)
